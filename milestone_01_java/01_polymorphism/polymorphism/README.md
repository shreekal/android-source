## Polymorphism

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (polymorphism). Edit `Main.java` and re-do the work indicated using polymorphism.

After you've finished, compile your code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/polymorph/*.java src/com/bloc/polymorph/pets/*.java
```

After it compiles successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

``` bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, execute your code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ java -ea com.bloc.polymorph.Main
```

If you see a nice congrats message, you've successfully poly-morphed!
